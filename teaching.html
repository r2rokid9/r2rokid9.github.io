				<p>Along with working to improve myself in terms of character and skills, I do my best to provide knowledge and help other individuals build foundations that will help them in their future careers or goals. This is also one of the reasons why I chose to pursue a field in teaching about computing, and other disciplines related to things I am knowledgeable about.</p>
				<p>Although I have been certified as a Google Certified Educator and a Microsoft Certified Educator, my true measure of being an educator lies in the passion and willingess to share your knowledge and express them in ways that can be understood and embraced by learners who are curious and willing to learn more about what they feel passionate about.</p>
				<p>This belief of mine has carried over into my willingness to share my knowledge when I am called to do so or voluntarily. Below, you will find a list of areas that I have shared my knowledge in a higher education setting, an invited talk, or a voluntary tutorial service. If you are in need of a speaker / instructor / tutorial service regarding the topics mentioned below, feel free to contact me.</p>
